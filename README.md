# Newton Dark UI theme

Another dark UI theme for Atom.

This theme is based on the Atom Dark UI theme, but has vertical file tabs and can be activated by going to
the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_UI Themes_ drop-down menu.

Use the Newton Dark Syntax syntax theme for more newtonian goodness.
